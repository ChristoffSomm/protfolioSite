	<h1>Life Story I Guess</h1><p>I’m Christoffer and I’m a Video Editor, Motion Graphics Artist, and Front End Developer.  I have written, editing and producing videos for many years now. One of the first videos I've ever created was me running for president/Vice President of my High School. I have a link if you want to check it out. (Click Me). The video was meant to be more of a parody but I end up getting a lot of votes. I find the video sometimes be a little cringe but I’m proud of it because it started off my journey into the art of media. Fun fact I wrote, shot, edited and produced that video in less than 24 hours; it wasn't even a school assignment. The started learning the basics of film and video and began dabbling in the Adobe suite programs. I started out learning After Effects and Soundbooth; these programs were mostly self-taught but I had a high school teacher guild me and support me through this journey.  Ms. Carda taught me how to use audacity (A free sound edited software). Which translated well over to Soundbooth and now Adobe Addition. She also convinced me to join BPA (Business Professionals of America) during my senior year. This organization had a media competition in which you produce a video to promote the clubs national competition for next year. I didn't have any video footage from nationals of previous years or anything. So decided to use after effects and make a two-minute long motion graphic. (Click Here [When I Find it]) It turned pretty well and I was proud of it. I got 1st in regional and 1st in state, however, in nationals I got 11th. I graduated and decided this would be my future interest. Finally, we made it to college!!! I started at 2-year college (Northwest College) studying film. These years I learn more advanced levels of film. Also being able to get a lot of hands-on experience. During my time at Northwest, my Professor Troy Hunt taught me a lot of video/film techniques and gave me a lot of experience; here’s a list…</p>

	<p>I bet there is a lot more but I can’t think of all of it now. During this time I also took an intern job at Eastmans’ Hunting Journal.  I spent most of my time logging footage into Cat-DV but occasionally my boss, Lindsay Simpson, would give me a graphic to work on or a smaller edit. I also got the chance to film some show opener and a rewarding drill. It was one of my first hands-on field experience. I got to run a camera for a bit and use and run a boom mic. Working for the company, later on, I got to do bigger edits like the Beyond the Grid series and handle more gear reviews. Moving on to the next chapter; after I got my associate's in film. I moved to Missoula to study Media Arts at the University of Montana. Here I learn more theory and how to appreciate the art I make. I got the chance to take a class about interactive art. I did a lot of project in this class but my favorite was “Natural Distribution”. In this project, we took an Xbox 360 Kinect to track someone motion. As they moved across the screen a new video would play. I took up the mantel to learn java and program the Kinect. I had no prior experience with Java but I still learn enough to get it to work. I think the project turned out great and I’m proud of it. After that, I started teaching myself programming. I started with learning python and later took a Web technology class, taught by Professor Michael Cassens, and learned JavaScript. Professor Michael Cassens, also during this time help me set up this website to showcase my portfolio work. This is where I’m at so far in my life. I will continue to update this page as more stuff happens. </p>
